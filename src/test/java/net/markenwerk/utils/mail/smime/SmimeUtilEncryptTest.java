""" 
Scenario 1: Test to check if the encrypt method returns a new S/MIME encrypted message successfully.

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulEncryption.
  Description: This test is designed to verify if the encrypt method is able to successfully encrypt a given MimeMessage using the provided Session and X509Certificate. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Session, MimeMessage, and X509Certificate for use in the test.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the prepared Session, MimeMessage, and X509Certificate.
  Assert: Assert that the returned MimeMessage is not null and is different from the original MimeMessage.
Validation: 
  This assertion checks if the encrypt method returns a new MimeMessage different from the original. This verifies the method's functionality of creating a new S/MIME encrypted MimeMessage.

Scenario 2: Test to check if the encrypt method throws an exception when a null Session is provided.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullSession.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the encrypt method throws an exception when a null Session is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid MimeMessage and X509Certificate. Provide a null Session.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the null Session, MimeMessage, and X509Certificate.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null inputs by throwing an exception. This is crucial for avoiding null pointer exceptions during runtime.

Scenario 3: Test to check if the encrypt method throws an exception when a null MimeMessage is provided.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullMimeMessage.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the encrypt method throws an exception when a null MimeMessage is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Session and X509Certificate. Provide a null MimeMessage.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the Session, null MimeMessage, and X509Certificate.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null inputs by throwing an exception. This is critical for avoiding null pointer exceptions during runtime.

Scenario 4: Test to check if the encrypt method throws an exception when a null X509Certificate is provided.

Details:  
  TestName: testNullCertificate.
  Description: This test is designed to check if the encrypt method throws an exception when a null X509Certificate is provided.
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid Session and MimeMessage. Provide a null X509Certificate.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the Session, MimeMessage, and null X509Certificate.
  Assert: Assert that an exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  This assertion verifies that the method correctly handles null inputs by throwing an exception. This is important for preventing null pointer exceptions during runtime.
