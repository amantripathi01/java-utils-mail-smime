Scenario 1: Test to check if getAssociatedAddresses returns the correct email addresses.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAssociatedAddressesReturnsCorrectEmails
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly extracts and returns the email addresses associated with the certificate's subject distinguished name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a SmimeKey instance with a certificate containing multiple email addresses in the subject distinguished name.
  Act: Invoke the getAssociatedAddresses method on the SmimeKey instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to compare the returned list of email addresses against the known list of email addresses from the certificate's subject distinguished name.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly extracts and returns all email addresses from the certificate's subject distinguished name. This is important as it ensures the application can correctly identify all associated email addresses for a given SmimeKey.

Scenario 2: Test to check if getAssociatedAddresses handles a certificate with no email addresses.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAssociatedAddressesWithNoEmails
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly handles a certificate with no email addresses in its subject distinguished name. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a SmimeKey instance with a certificate containing no email addresses in the subject distinguished name.
  Act: Invoke the getAssociatedAddresses method on the SmimeKey instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list of email addresses is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly handles a certificate with no email addresses, returning an empty list. This is important as it ensures the application can correctly handle certificates with no associated email addresses.

Scenario 3: Test to check if getAssociatedAddresses handles a null certificate.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAssociatedAddressesWithNullCertificate
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly handles a null certificate.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a SmimeKey instance with a null certificate.
  Act: Invoke the getAssociatedAddresses method on the SmimeKey instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list of email addresses is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly handles a null certificate, returning an empty list. This is important as it ensures the application can correctly handle SmimeKeys with null certificates.

Scenario 4: Test to check if getAssociatedAddresses handles a certificate with an invalid subject distinguished name.

Details:  
  TestName: testGetAssociatedAddressesWithInvalidDistinguishedName
  Description: This test is meant to check if the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly handles a certificate with an invalid subject distinguished name.
Execution:
  Arrange: Set up a SmimeKey instance with a certificate containing an invalid subject distinguished name.
  Act: Invoke the getAssociatedAddresses method on the SmimeKey instance.
  Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check that the returned list of email addresses is empty.
Validation: 
  The assertion aims to verify that the getAssociatedAddresses method correctly handles a certificate with an invalid subject distinguished name, returning an empty list. This is important as it ensures the application can correctly handle certificates with invalid subject distinguished names.
