ROOST_METHOD_SIG_HASH=encrypt_52f23f8de0

Scenario 1: Successful encryption of a MimeBodyPart using a valid certificate

Details:  
  TestName: testSuccessfulEncryptionWithValidCertificate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method successfully encrypts a MimeBodyPart when provided with a valid X509Certificate. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a MimeBodyPart and a valid X509Certificate. 
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the created MimeBodyPart and X509Certificate.
  Assert: Check if the returned MimeBodyPart is not null and is of expected format.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly encrypts the MimeBodyPart. The expected result is a non-null MimeBodyPart of a certain format, which indicates successful encryption. This test is significant as it validates the core functionality of the method under normal conditions.

Scenario 2: Handling of null MimeBodyPart

Details:  
  TestName: testEncryptionWithNullMimeBodyPart.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles a null MimeBodyPart appropriately. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a valid X509Certificate and set MimeBodyPart as null.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the null MimeBodyPart and the created X509Certificate.
  Assert: Check if the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when a null MimeBodyPart is provided. This test is significant as it checks the method's resilience to invalid input.

Scenario 3: Handling of null X509Certificate

Details:  
  TestName: testEncryptionWithNullCertificate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles a null X509Certificate appropriately. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a MimeBodyPart and set X509Certificate as null.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the created MimeBodyPart and null X509Certificate.
  Assert: Check if the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when a null X509Certificate is provided. This test is significant as it checks the method's resilience to invalid input.

Scenario 4: Handling of invalid X509Certificate

Details:  
  TestName: testEncryptionWithInvalidCertificate.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles an invalid X509Certificate appropriately. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a MimeBodyPart and an invalid X509Certificate.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the created MimeBodyPart and invalid X509Certificate.
  Assert: Check if the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when an invalid X509Certificate is provided. This test is significant as it checks the method's resilience to invalid input.

Scenario 5: Encryption process throws an exception

Details:  
  TestName: testEncryptionProcessException.
  Description: This test is meant to check if the method handles exceptions thrown during the encryption process appropriately. 
Execution:
  Arrange: Create a MimeBodyPart and a X509Certificate such that the encryption process would throw an exception.
  Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the created MimeBodyPart and X509Certificate.
  Assert: Check if the appropriate exception is thrown.
Validation: 
  The assertion verifies that the method correctly handles exceptions thrown during the encryption process. This test is significant as it checks the method's resilience to runtime errors.
