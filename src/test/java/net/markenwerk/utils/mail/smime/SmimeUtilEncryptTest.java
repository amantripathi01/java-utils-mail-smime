  Scenario 1: Test encryption with valid parameters

  Details:  
    TestName: testEncryptionWithValidParameters
    Description: This test is meant to check the encryption functionality using valid Session, MimeMessage and X509Certificate parameters. The target scenario is where all parameters are properly initialized and the certificate is valid for encryption. 
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid Session, MimeMessage, and X509Certificate.
    Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the set up parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the returned MimeMessage is not null and has been encrypted properly.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the encryption is successful and the returned MimeMessage is as expected. This is important to ensure the encryption functionality works correctly with valid inputs.

  Scenario 2: Test encryption with null parameters

  Details:  
    TestName: testEncryptionWithNullParameters
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the encrypt method when null parameters are passed. The target scenario is where either the Session, MimeMessage, or X509Certificate is null.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a null Session, MimeMessage, or X509Certificate.
    Act: Invoke the encrypt method with the null parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the expected exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when null parameters are passed. This is to ensure the method handles null parameters correctly and fails early.

  Scenario 3: Test encryption with invalid certificate

  Details:  
    TestName: testEncryptionWithInvalidCertificate
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the encrypt method when an invalid X509Certificate is passed. The target scenario is where the certificate is not appropriate for encryption.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid Session and MimeMessage, but an invalid X509Certificate.
    Act: Invoke the encrypt method with these parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the expected exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when an invalid certificate is used. This is to ensure the method handles invalid certificates correctly and fails early.

  Scenario 4: Test encryption when an error occurs during the process

  Details:  
    TestName: testEncryptionWhenErrorOccurs
    Description: This test is meant to check the behavior of the encrypt method when an error occurs during the encryption process. The target scenario is where an unexpected error (like an IOException) occurs.
  Execution:
    Arrange: Set up a valid Session, MimeMessage, and X509Certificate but mock the encryption process to throw an IOException.
    Act: Invoke the encrypt method with these parameters.
    Assert: Use JUnit assertions to check if the expected exception is thrown.
  Validation: 
    The assertion verifies that the method throws an exception when an error occurs during the encryption process. This is to ensure the method handles such errors correctly and fails early.
